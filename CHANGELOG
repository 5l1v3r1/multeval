V0.5.0 - 11/30/2012
* Bug fix for BLEU implementation
* Added Travis CI regression tests
* Added ability to produce sentence-level scores
* More verbose output for BLEU


V0.4.3 - 8/27/2012
* Upgraded to Meteor 1.4 (also released 8/27/2012)
  - Note: This change only affects previously unsupported languages by enabling new stemmers

V0.4.2 - 12/3/2012
* Fixed bug in n-best scoring that caused oracle *submetrics* such as precision and recall (not main BLEU, TER, METEOR, etc. scores) to be reported incorrectly for oracle hypotheses
* Multi-threaded bootstrap resampling and approximate randomization significance tests (large time savings for many systems with many optimization runs)
* Updated to Guava V11

Some timing results on 32 threads vs 4 threads vs 1 using the recent multi-threading improvements on the 3 example systems with 3 optimizer runs each:
                                32  /         4 /          1
Load METEOR                   41.5s /     25.5s /      25.5s
Collect Sufficient Stats      14.8s /     32.7s /      86.7s
Bootstrap Resampling          35.2s /     70.9s /     189s
Approximate Randomization     19.4s /    122s   /     336s
TOTAL                      1m 54s   / 4m  13s   / 10m  39s


V0.4.1 - 12/30/2011
* Fix sizing bug reported by John DeNero, which caused MultEval to crash
* Removed "static" keyword from several places within the TER library to make it more amenable to multi-threading


V0.4 - 12/30/2011
* Multi-thread sufficient stats computation where possible (multi-threading of bootstrap resampling and approximate randomization are still on the to-do list)
* Include constants file in distribution
* A few other small optimizations
* Include example n-best list


V0.3 - 8/10/2011
* Use Meteor 1.3
* Better reporting of metric descriptions in Latex table
* Ability to find oracle-worst hypotheses from n-best list
* Better incremental status when processing n-best lists


V0.2 - 6/29/2011
* Use more aggressive shuffling algorithm for approximate randomization for better p-values in corner cases
* Dump prettier ASCII table upon completion


V0.1 - 6/21/2011
* Initial Release
